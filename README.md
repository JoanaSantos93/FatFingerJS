# JavaScirpt

**Write JS with your fists!**

Write JS in any old sloppy way and **JavaScirpt** (*JA'va-SERP't*: named for the most common mispelling of JavaScript), you're trying to do. Why bother writing clean, well-formatted JS when you can do this?

~~~
    <script type="text/javascript" src="javascirpt.js"></script>   
    <script type="text/javoscript"><!-- any misspelling of javascript works here -->
        // here is my inline javascirrrrpt!
        vart x = "herrrllo werld"

        dokkkkumint.rit3(xx)
    </script>

Don't bother with semi-colons. Open brackets and never close them. Misspell keywords, variables, and method names.

To use, just include javascirpt.js in your project, add a script tag with any misspelling of JavaScript, and write your sloppy, shitty JS.

A couple of usage notes: You'll need to declare vars as if option explicit, so that JavaScirpt can fix typos that might otherwise look like new declarations. Also, JavaScirpt has a poor concept of scope, so it you're doing fancy OO stuff, ask yourself: is there a good reason I haven't made everything global???

*Project is still under construction / testing.*

Number of times I misspelled *JavaScirpt* as *JavaScript* while creating this: **6**
